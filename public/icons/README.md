# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Solution

For development purposes, you can create simple colored squares or use online icon generators:

1. Go to https://www.favicon.io/ or similar service
2. Create icons with the text "FG" or a shield symbol
3. Download and rename them to the required sizes
4. Place them in this directory

## Design Guidelines

- Use a shield or lock symbol to represent security
- Colors: Use the brand colors from the UI (#667eea, #764ba2)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
